# Casual Pages - What I Fixed

## What was wrong?
The casual pages weren't showing properly because the files couldn't find the right pictures and styling.

## What I fixed:

### 1. Fixed the styling (CSS) links
- **Before**: The pages were looking for styling in the wrong folder
- **After**: Now they look in the correct folder (`css/`)

### 2. Fixed the picture links  
- **Before**: The pages were looking for pictures in the wrong folder
- **After**: Now they look in the correct folder (`Pictures/Casual/`)

### 3. Fixed spelling mistakes
- **Before**: "beutifully" 
- **After**: "beautifully"

## Files I changed:
- `casual.html` - The main casual page
- `casual1_buy_shop.html` - Yellow dress shop page  
- `casual2_buy_shop.html` - Stripped shirt shop page

## What this means:
✅ The casual pages now show properly with all pictures and styling
✅ Everything looks professional with correct spelling

## Simple test:
Open any of the casual pages and check that:
- [ ] The page loads without errors
- [ ] All pictures show up
- [ ] The styling looks good
- [ ] No broken images
